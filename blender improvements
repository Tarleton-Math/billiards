Camera at x=0, y=0, z=1.5*box length

Show all walls except “front” and top one (at z=box length)

Shadows - show only on floor (or none at all)

No shadows on the particles themselves (not so important, if difficult)

Increase contrast between particles and walls

Color particles based on temperature

Color walls based on temperature

  Add record type to visualization file for wall temp
  
  Currently, all point on same wall are same temp.  But might consider “hotspots” on same wall of different temp.
  
  Does blender make it easy to do color interpolation?
